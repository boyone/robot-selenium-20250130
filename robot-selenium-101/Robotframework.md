# Robotframework

Robot Framework is an open-source automation framework that is used for test automation and robotic process automation (RPA). It is keyword-driven, meaning that it uses keywords to abstract the details of the tests, making them more readable and maintainable. Robot Framework is highly extensible and can be integrated with various libraries and tools, such as SeleniumLibrary for web testing.

Key features of Robot Framework include:

- `Keyword-driven testing`: Tests are written using keywords, which can be user-defined or come from external libraries.
- `Extensibility`: Supports custom libraries and tools, allowing for a wide range of testing scenarios.
- `Data-driven testing`: Allows for running the same test with different sets of input data.
- `Clear and readable syntax`: Uses a simple, readable syntax that makes it easy to write and understand tests.
